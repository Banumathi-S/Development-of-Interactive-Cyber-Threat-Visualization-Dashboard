For `(10 % -3)`, the largest multiple of `-3` less than or equal to `10` is `9` (or more accurately, `10 = (-3) * (-3) + 1`), resulting in `1`.\n",

Since the clock only goes up to `11`, you wrap around. `13 % 12` gives `1`. So, it will be `1` o'clock.

        "### Explanation of the Code\n",
        "- The `Animal` base class defines a `speak()` method (which raises `NotImplementedError` to indicate it should be overridden). This establishes a common interface.\n",
        "- `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Duck` are subclasses, and each provides its own unique implementation of the `speak()` method.\n",
        "- The `make_animal_speak()` function takes an `animal_obj`. It doesn't care *what specific type* of `Animal` it is, only that it has a `speak()` method. When `make_animal_speak(dog_obj)` is called, Python automatically calls `Dog`'s `speak()`. When `make_animal_speak(cat_obj)` is called, Python calls `Cat`'s `speak()`, and so on.\n",
        "- The loop `for animal in animals:` further illustrates this: the same `make_animal_speak()` call behaves differently depending on the actual object type at runtime.\n",
        "- The `Shape`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle` example shows polymorphism with an `area()` method, where each shape calculates its area differently but is accessed through the same method name.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Real-world Analogy\n",
        "Imagine you have a **\"Play\" button** on different media devices: a CD player, a DVD player, and an MP3 player. When you press the \"Play\" button on a CD player, it plays a CD. When you press it on a DVD player, it plays a DVD. When you press it on an MP3 player, it plays an MP3 file. The **\"Play\" action (method name) is the same**, but the **underlying mechanism (implementation) is different** for each device based on what it is designed to play. This is polymorphism – one interface, many implementations."
