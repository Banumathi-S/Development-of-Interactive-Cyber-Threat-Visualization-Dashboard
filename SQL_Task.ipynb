        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Numeric Data Types\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`INT`** (Integer): Stores whole numbers (e.g., `1`, `100`, `-5`).\n",
        "*   **`SMALLINT`**: Stores smaller whole numbers.\n",
        "*   **`BIGINT`**: Stores larger whole numbers.\n",
        "*   **`DECIMAL(p, s)`** or **`NUMERIC(p, s)`**: Stores exact numeric values with a fixed precision (`p` is the total number of digits, `s` is the number of digits after the decimal point). Useful for financial data.\n",
        "*   **`FLOAT`** or **`REAL`**: Stores approximate floating-point numbers. Use with caution for precise calculations due to potential rounding issues.\n",
        "*   **`DOUBLE PRECISION`**: Similar to `FLOAT` but with higher precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "### String Data Types\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`VARCHAR(n)`** (Variable Character): Stores strings of varying length, up to a maximum of `n` characters. It's space-efficient as it only uses storage for the actual length of the string.\n",
        "*   **`CHAR(n)`** (Fixed Character): Stores strings of a fixed length `n`. If a string is shorter than `n`, it's padded with spaces. Generally less common than `VARCHAR` unless you have consistently fixed-length data.\n",
        "*   **`TEXT`**: Stores long strings of text. The maximum length can vary by database system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Date and Time Data Types\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`DATE`**: Stores a date (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`).\n",
        "*   **`TIME`**: Stores a time of day (e.g., `HH:MM:SS`).\n",
        "*   **`DATETIME`** or **`TIMESTAMP`**: Stores both date and time (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`). `TIMESTAMP` often includes timezone information or tracks when a record was last modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Boolean Data Types\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`BOOLEAN`** or **`BIT`**: Stores `TRUE` or `FALSE` values. Some databases might use `0` for `FALSE` and `1` for `TRUE`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Other Data Types\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`BLOB`** (Binary Large Object): Stores binary data such as images, audio, or other files.\n",
        "*   **`UUID`** (Universally Unique Identifier): Stores a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems.\n",
